**Flywork** is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in. Join the team!

- Before you begin work, make sure to clear it with the project owner. It will save a lot of time down the road.
- Fork the project over to your account, do not request repository access.
- Please be sure to check out the FAQ (when it is available) to see if any questions you have are already answered.
- Please don't "bump" your issue(s). If you've filled it, I have seen it.
- Please be sure to follow coding styles guideline (according [PSR2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/))
